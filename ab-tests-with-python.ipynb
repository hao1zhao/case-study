    "**Before**\n",
    "* At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\".\n",
    "* If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.\n",
    "* If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After**\n",
    "* In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course.\n",
    "* If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.\n",
    "* At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.\n",

    "### 1.3  Metrics Choice <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"metric\"></a>\n",
    "The following are the possible metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any place \"unique cookies\" are mentioned, the uniqueness is determined by day. (That is, the same cookie visiting on different days would be counted twice.) User-ids are automatically unique since the site does not allow the same user-id to enroll twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of cookies**: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min}=3000$)\n",
    "- **Number of user-ids**: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. ($d_{min}=50$)\n",
    "- **Number of clicks**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). ($d_{min}=240$)\n",
    "- **Click-through-probability**: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",
    "- **Gross conversion**: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",
    "- **Retention**: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of user-ids to complete checkout. ($d_{min}=0.01$)\n",
    "- **Net conversion**: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. ($d_{min}=0.0075$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success metric :** directly measures the desired outcome and is connected to what you're trying to learn from the experiment, the success metric of an experiment must contain the following properties:\n",
    "* Observable in the short term\n",
    "* Sensitive to changes  i.e. top line (like retention) are often too insensitive to be impacted\n",

    "We need two types of metrics for a successful experiment (or at least, a safe one); Guardrail and Success metrics.\n",
    "Guardrail metrics are used for \"sanity checks\", that is, to make sure our experiment (the way we presented a change to a part of the population, as well as the way we collected the data) is not inherently wrong. Basically, this means we pick metrics which we consider not to change (not to be affected) because of our experiment and later make sure these metrics don't change drastically between our control and experiment groups.<br>\n",
    "Success metrics on the other hand, are the metrics in which we expect to see a change, and are relevant to the business goals we aim to achieve.\n",

    "In the same way, we set MDE for hypothesis, we set a Non-inferiority Margin for guardrail metrics... which represent the largest change we are willing to accept for a metrics to prove that it's not worth that before.\n",
    "Therefore, a reasonable Guardrail metric becomes **Click-through-probability** (number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page.)\n",
